As a result of these changes the points total held by One Hotspur Season Ticket Holders and Members will consist of the points gained in the previous 4 full seasons, as well as the current campaign. For example, for the start of the 2016/17 season the points gained for continuous membership will be totalled for the following seasons:2012/132013/142014/152015/16 In addition, this total will be added to by any points gained during the 2016/17 season. At the end of next season, then any points from the 2012/13 season will fall away to be replaced by points gained during the 2016/17 and also through the forthcoming 2017/18 season. 9.2 Loyalty points will be awarded to Members for joining One Hotspur Platinum, Gold or Silver with additional points being awarded when attending away games or home Cup-Ties (excluding the first two which are included in the Season Ticket offering). 9.3 Bronze and Lilywhite Members will be awarded Loyalty Points each time they attend a match with a ticket assigned to their One Hotspur membership account at the time of purchase, home or away. 9.4 The amount of points issued will depend on the grade of the game and will be detailed through the Club\u2019s Communication Channels. In determining the allocation of loyalty points (which is entirely at the Club\u2019s discretion), we take in to account a number of factors such as the relative attractiveness of the opposition, the competition, the stage of competition, the day of the week, the time of year, venue of the match, typical travel distances for the majority of our fans, and the availability of the match on live TV or Spurs TV Online internet streaming. 9.5 Loyalty points will be used to allocate tickets when demand exceeds the allocation of tickets for matches away from White Hart Lane (e.g. Arsenal away or a Cup Final). The Club will clearly advise via the Communication Channels the number of loyalty points required to be able to apply for tickets to certain fixtures. 9.6 When loyalty points are used to allocate tickets for away fixtures, all Members must each have the required number of loyalty points individually, when applying for tickets in a group. Only the member of the group with sufficient loyalty points will qualify for a ticket. Tickets will NOT be issued based on the average number of points. If the supporter who submitted the application is unsuccessful then tickets will be sent to the registered address of a successful member of that group. 9.7 Members can check their loyalty point total by visiting the \u201cMy Account\u201d page in the Ticketing section of tottenhamhotspur.com 9.8 The Club reserves the right to allocate away match tickets with official Club travel packages. In such circumstances, loyalty points may not apply. 9.9 Any queries relating to a member\u2019s loyalty points MUST be raised with the Ticket Office in writing/via email. Any queries relating to points allocated for matches prior to the season before the current campaign will not be considered. 9.10 Should a Member or Season Ticket Holder miss the date of renewal, they will be treated as a new Member, with their loyalty points total returning to zero. 9.11 Loyalty points will only be awarded for tickets purchased via the Ticket Office, telephone lines or website. No points will be issued for tickets purchased at turnstiles. 9.12 Tickets purchased outside of the Members Priority period must be assigned to individual members at the point of sale in order for Loyalty Points to be awarded. If tickets are not assigned to individual members at the point of sale it will not be possible to award Loyalty Points retrospectively. 9.13 Different loyalty point systems operate for Season Ticket holders and Bronze and Lilywhite members.

However, it is the sole responsibility of the Platinum and Gold Members to keep their email address registered with the Club up to date. 4.4.2 For the 2016/17 season, where home matches in The UEFA Champions League will be played at Wembley Stadium, ALL season ticket holders will be required to purchase their tickets for these fixtures. The Automatic Cup Scheme WILL NOT be in operation for UEFA matches at Wembley Stadium for this season. 4.4.2 The credit/debit card details that have been provided to charge the cost of the Season Ticket will NOT be registered as payment details for all Cup-Ties not included within the Season Ticket. As a result, these details must be kept up to date. The Club will attempt to contact the Platinum or Gold Member by email when encountering issues with a payment card although the Club will not accept any responsibility if this email is not read, opened or is sent to an email address that is out of date or is filtered out through a spam guard. In the event the Platinum or Gold Member fails to update their payment information the Club will not issue the home Cup-Tie ticket and the Platinum or Gold Member\u2019s seat will be offered for sale for that particular home Cup-Tie. If the payment details remain out of date for any subsequent home Cup-Tie, it will be assumed that the Platinum or Gold Member wishes to cancel participation in the scheme and the conditions in clause 4.4.4 will apply. 4.4.3 It is not possible to opt out of the scheme for a particular home Cup-Tie for any reason. In the event that the home Cup-Tie ticket is not required by the Platinum or Gold Member for one of the first two home cup-ties of the season, the ticket may be sold using the Ticket Exchange Scheme specified in clause 5 of these Terms and Conditions. After the first two home cup-ties have taken place the usual seven day refund policy will be implemented, as outlined in 2.3. 4.4.4 If a Platinum or Gold Member wishes to cancel their participation in the home Cup-Tie Guarantee scheme they must put their request in writing/via email and give 28 days notice of the likely date of the next scheduled home Cup-Tie. Upon cancellation, 5 points will be deducted from their loyalty points and it will not be possible to opt back in to the scheme for the remainder of the Season.

Who is entitled to apply for match tickets at White Hart Lane during the members application period? All One Hotspur Bronze and Lilywhite members are able to submit a single application per match. Members are entitled to apply for one ticket per match. Tickets can be applied for in groups of no more than four members. To make the application process as easy as possible you are advised to visit your online ticketing account and add members to your network if you intend to apply for tickets together for matches. 2. How do I make a ballot application? Applications can be submitted online via your etickets account at any time during the advertised period. If you are unable to apply online then applications can also be submitted by phone during the advertised application period by calling 0344 844 0102 (UK) or from overseas on +44 20 7998 1068, option 2. Lines are open Monday - Friday, 09:30 - 17:00. 3. When can I make a ballot application? A full list of Application periods for the 2016/17 season can be found here. (http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/tickets/application-dates/) 4. How many tickets are available in the ballot? The total number of tickets available will vary game to game, partly depending on how many tickets the visiting team will take for their allocation. Every effort will be made to ensure the maximum number of tickets are available when the ballot is run. As a general rule, a minimum of 4,500) tickets will be available in the ballot for each Premier League home match. 5. How many members can I apply with? Current One Hotspur Bronze and Lilywhite members can apply in groups of up to four in total. This maximum limit has been introduced following analysis of the breakdown of available seats as well as the average size of group purchases in recent seasons. Extending group applications to more than four would potentially significantly reduce the success chances of those applying in larger groups due to limited availability seats together to accommodate such applications. 6. Who conducts the ballot? The ballot will be carried out by the Tottenham Hotspur ticketing team, with input from Ticketmaster. Members of the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters Trust will be invited in periodically to observe the ballot process being carried out. 7. How will tickets be allocated in the ballot process for 'Category B and C' matches at White Hart Lane? An individual ballot process will be run for each price level within the stadium. A member who applies to be considered for a ticket at all price levels will be entered into the ballot process for every area until they are either successful or all tickets are allocated. As explained in Answer 8 below, any member who limits the price they wish to be considered for is obviously able to do that but will potentially reduce their chances of success as a result. Tickets will be allocated in a \u201ctop down\u201d method. i.e. the higher priced seats will be allocated first. If we went with a process where tickets at the lower price were allocated first, across all applicants then the chances for those who have applied just for the lower price will be far lower. By running a \u201ctop down\u201d process we will be continually removing people who are willing to pay a higher price as we work through the price levels, therefore increasing the chances of those that only wish to / can only afford to pay the lower price. 8. How will tickets be allocated in the ballot process for 'Category A' matches at White Hart Lane The application process will work exactly the same way for all Premier League matches at White Hart Lane, as set out in this FAQ document. For the home matches against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and West Ham tickets will be allocated using Members\u2019 individual loyalty points. This process will work in a similar way to away matches in that all Members must each have the required number of loyalty points individually, when applying for tickets in a group. Only the member of the group with sufficient loyalty points will qualify for a ticket. Tickets will NOT be issued based on the average number of points within a group. When submitting an application, members will still be asked to specify an upper limit they are willing to accept for match tickets. As detailed in Answer 10 below, if a member opts to limit the price range they are willing to be considered for when they submit an application they will potentially reduce their chances of success. The Loyalty Point cut off that is announced for each Category A home match will not guarantee a ticket in the event that a member has limited the ticket price that they are willing to accept. 9. Will all members of my group be seated together? Yes, successful applicants applying in groups will be sat together with the people they applied with. 10. Can I select a specific price or area to apply for? You are asked to select the MAXIMUM price you would be willing to pay for a ticket for each match. If you select the top price then you will be considered for an available ticket in all areas of the stadium and therefore maximise your chances of getting a ticket. Should you wish to restrict the price you wish to pay for a ticket then you are able to do so at the point of application. By limiting your selection you are of course reducing the chances of being allocated a ticket. 11. Can I select a specific seat(s) for a match? Unfortunately it will not be possible for members to select specific individual seats to purchase for a match. Part of the ballot process will be to ensure that all spaces are full and groups are kept together. If we adopted a process of allowing people to go in and choose specific seats from all those that are available we would very quickly be left with single seats or odd numbers that mean people within a group application would be unable to purchase seats together. 12. How do I apply for a concession ticket? (Under 18 or over 65 years of age) Concession tickets will continue to be allocated in the North Stand for all matches and in the North and South Stands for Category B and Category C matches. Members who are successful in the ballot for a ticket in an area where concessionary prices apply will automatically be charged the correct price that their membership entitles them to. If a member only wishes to be considered for a concessionary priced ticket they should only select that price option at the point of application. Any member allocated a ticket in areas where reduced prices are not available for concessions will be charged the prevailing full price for a match ticket. 13. How will I know if I am successful? Once the ballot process has been run, all applicants will be sent an email to confirm whether or not their application has been successful. Allocated seats will also be listed on Members\u2019 Account history on their online account. As always, we would urge members to ensure that all of their contact details are up to date to ensure they receive all email communications. 14. Can I amend my application once it is submitted? Once you have submitted an application for a match you are unable to alter it. You are able to cancel the original application online and resubmit a new application at any point during the application process. 15. If my application is successful, when will I be charged? When you make an application you are asked to submit credit/debit card details. When the ballot process is run shortly after the closing date the card details of successful applicants will be charged the full amount for every ticket within an application, plus booking fees. Should payment fail the lead applicant will be emailed to advise that payment has not been successful. The tickets allocated will be placed on reserve for a limited time and the Members will be given a deadline in which to make the correct payment, either online or over the phone (0344 844 0102 \u2013 Option 2). Failure to complete payment within this period will result in the tickets being cancelled and re-issued to other members who were unsuccessful in the original ballot. 16. Can I cancel my tickets if I am successful in the ballot but can no longer attend or do not want the tickets I am allocated? Yes. Anyone wishing to cancel the tickets they have been allocated can do so by sending an email to ticketoffice@tottenhamhotspur.com. Any tickets that are cancelled up to seven days prior to the fixture date will receive a full refund (excluding booking fees). Members should clearly detail in their email the fixture and number of tickets they wish to cancel and which members wish to cancel from their group. Any cancellation requests received later than seven full days prior to the match will receive a full refund (excluding booking fees) once their tickets have been successfully re-sold to One Hotspur members that originally were unsuccessful in the ballot process It is important to remember that it is against the Terms and Conditions of One Hotspur Membership to re-sell or pass on a match ticket to another person. Anyone found to have sold or transferred a ticket via unofficial channels (including via Social Media) will have their membership and any allocated tickets cancelled with immediate effect. This will be enforced in an effort to ensure that the reduced ticket availability is allocated as fairly as possible to existing One Hotspur members. 17. How will any cancelled tickets be allocated? Any cancelled tickets will be randomly allocated to members who applied in the original process but were unsuccessful. 18. How will I receive the tickets? As in previous seasons, tickets will be loaded on to your One Hotspur stadium access cards. Members are reminded that new cards are being issued ahead of the 2016/2017 season and that you should ensure that the correct and most up to date card is brought to the stadium on match day. Members are also reminded that tickets/stadium access Cards are strictly non-transferable. 19. Is it possible for a Season Ticket holder to relocate to sit with a member who is successful in the ballot? Season Ticket holders will be able to request to relocate their seat for an individual game in order for them to sit with a member(s) who has been successful in being allocated a match ticket via the members\u2019 ballot. The Season Ticket holder should send an email to ticketoffice@tottenhamhotspur.com AFTER the ballot and once the member has been advised that they have been allocated a ticket. All relocation requests will be considered but are strictly subject to availability. Priority will be given to requests for Season Ticket holders to be relocated to sit alongside Junior members who have obtained a ticket via the ballot. In the event that a relocation is not possible then a full refund will be offered to the member.", "question": "How does the ballot system work?
